# About this Repo
This Repo is a Fork of [librespot-android](https://github.com/devgianlu/librespot-android). But it implements more features and also has some design added to it.
  - [x] Search for Songs
  - [x] Add Songs to Queue
  - [ ] Add Songs to Playlist
  - [ ] Search for other Stuff than just Songs
  - [ ] Play Playlists

# Why does this Project exists?
I am a very big fan of listening to music while I am on the go and I also like privacy. But unfortenetly the offical Spotify android client contains many trackers, like Facebook Analytics, Google CrashLytics and [many more](https://reports.exodus-privacy.eu.org/en/reports/com.spotify.music/latest/). One solution would be to use the spotify web app. But on mobile devices the offical version lacks many features like:
  - Adding songs to a queue
  - Showing your favoutite songs
  - Adding songs to your playlists
  - Sowing your Library

If you don't need these features it's perfectly fine, but I need them, so I decided to start this project.

# WIP (*W*ork *I*n *P*rogress)
The Project is in a very eraly state there are many features not yet implemented and there are also some features that will *crash* the app. I will push updates without any regularity.

# [librespot-android](https://github.com/devgianlu/librespot-android)

This is a demo application to demonstrate that it is possible to run [librespot-java](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot-java) on an Android device. The app provides basic functionalities to login and then to play a custom URI, pause/resume, skip next and previous, but all features could be implemented. 

This repo also contains some useful modules that contain Android-compatible sinks and decoders that you might want to use in your app.
